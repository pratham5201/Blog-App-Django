# Room-Chat sample application

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ https://github.com/pratham5201/Blog-App-Django.git
$ cd Blog-App-Django
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `venv`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

   - Implement media handling for blog post images.

8. **Django Middleware:**
   - Implement middleware for global request/response processing.
   - Handle authentication, security checks, or custom headers.

9. **Django Signals:**
   - Use signals for certain events (e.g., sending notifications when a new post is published).

10. **Django REST Framework (Optional):**
    - Create a RESTful API for the blog using Django REST Framework.
    - Allow users to retrieve and interact with blog data via API endpoints.

11. **Django Forms for Comments:**

    - Validate and process comment data.

12. **Django Template Tags and Filters:**
    - Create custom template tags and filters for rendering blog-related content.

13. **Django Middleware for Caching (Optional):**
    - Implement caching for blog pages to improve performance.
    - Use Django's caching framework.

14. **Django Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):**
    - Internationalize your blog application for multiple languages.
    - Use translations for different parts of the application.

15. **Django File Handling:**
    - Manage file uploads for blog post images using Django's `FileField` and `ImageField`.
    - Handle file storage and retrieval with storage backends.

16. **Django Custom Management Commands:**
    - Create custom management commands for tasks such as data seeding or updating.

17. **Django Testing:**
    - Write unit tests and integration tests for your blog application.
    - Use Django's testing utilities and `TestCase` class.

18. **Django Security Best Practices:**
    - Follow Django's security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.
    - Implement secure password hashing, enable HTTPS, and validate user input.

This project will allow you to explore and implement a wide range of Django features, making your understanding of Django more robust. As you progress, you can continue to enhance and expand the features of your blog, adding more complexity and functionality.
